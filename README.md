## Student Performane Checker

1. Understanding problem statement
2. Data collection
3. Performing data checks
4. Data analysis
5. Pre-processing Data 
6. Model training
7. Choose the best model

1. problrm statement
    - The projects shows how the student's performance is affected by other variables such as gender, parental level education, ethnicity, race , luch etc..

2. Data collection and Packages
    - Datset consists of 8 rows and 1000 columns
    E:\PROJECTS\ML_Project\notebook\data\student_performance.csv
    - Import Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and warings library
    - DATASET INFO
        gender : sex of students -> (Male/female)
        race/ethnicity : ethnicity of students -> (Group A, B,C, D,E)
        parental level of education : parents' final education ->(bachelor's degree,some college,master's degree,associate's degree,high school)
        lunch : having lunch before test (standard or free/reduced)
        test preparation course : complete or not complete before test
        math score
        reading score
        writing score

    
3. Checking all the missing values
    - missing values, duplicates, data type, no of unique values 
    - check statistics of dataset, categories present in various forms


4. Analyszing the data using Visualization techniques
    - Comparing between gender and avearge
    - comparing between gender and test score
    - Plotting graghs for statistical data
    - plotting graphs for each columns 
    - comparing the values of columns between each other
